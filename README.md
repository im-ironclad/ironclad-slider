# Ironclad Slider
######A slider component ideally for a photographers portfolio to shift through photoshoots of different people/couples.

The goal was to host a lot of content (a lot of photos) in a small space so not to take up too much real estate on the page.  
I'm sure it could also be used for other content.
**Feel free to use this.**

If you do decide to change things up or make it work with other content and want to make a pull request feel free to do so and we could add more branches other than master.
***
In order to use: Fork and clone the repo to your local environment and point your browser to public/index.php. The scripts/styles have already been built but if you want to use gulp yourself and edit the files then run **npm install** then browse the gulpfile for possible tasks. Everything else should be straight forward.
