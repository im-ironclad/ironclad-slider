# Ironclad Slider
A slider component ideally for a photographers portfolio to shift through photoshoots of different people/couples.  
I'm sure it could also be used for other content.
**Feel free to use this.**
***
In order to use, clone the repo to your local environment and point your browser to public/index.php. The scripts/styles have already been built but if you want to use gulp yourself and edit the files then run **npm install** then browse the gulpfile for possible tasks.
